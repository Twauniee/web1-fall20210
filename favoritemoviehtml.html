        <h3>Plot Summary</h3>
        <p>Money Heist all started off with The professor wanting to rob a bank. He wanted to do what his father never finished. So he planned this heist his whole life. He did research and went around to grab a crew. Everyone he picked never seen each other, knew each other, or knew about each other. This was so if someone got caught they couldn't say anything about them. They weren't robbing the bank they were hijacking it to print their own money so basically, they weren't stealing. But once they started hijacking the bank people connected emotionally and things began to happen. The rest is for you to watch.
